 # Generate list of basal attributes

 Laypersons cognitively and emotionally evaluated the basal attributes, forming clusters of semantically related basal attributes using our recently developed [Cognitive-Affective Map Tools](https://github.com/Camel-app). The analyses contains four main files / folders: 

1. [01_dataPreperation.qmd](https://github.com/FennStatistics/Article_BasalAttributes/blob/main/Analyses/part_II/01_dataPreperation.qmd) - Dynamic script written with the [Quarto framework](https://quarto.org/) containing all steps for data pre-processing to get tidy / clean data
