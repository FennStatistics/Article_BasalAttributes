 # Generate list of basal attributes

 Generated a list of 32 basal attributes based on expert interviews and existing literature, involving three steps:

1. The initial basal attributes list from guided expert interviews was translated and reduced in multiple steps by experts.
    + The list was refined to exclude overly generic adjectives such as "modern" and "innovative" that lack specific relevance to material systems.
    + Ensuring the final list of basal attributes is easily understandable for laypersons.
2. A world café format was employed to facilitate an expert evaluation of the revised list.
    + Experts had the opportunity to propose additional attributes relevant to their distinct research areas.
3. Automated scans of existing livMatS publications were conducted to extract relevant adjectives to augment the attribute list.
