# livmats-basal-attributes-analysis

In the article we developed a methodology divided in three parts:
- Part I: Generated a list of 32 basal attributes based on expert interviews and existing literature.
- Part II: Laypersons cognitively and emotionally evaluated these attributes, forming clusters of semantically related basal attributes.
- Part III: Employed ChatGPT to systematically generate text about future material systems using identified clusters. These texts were evaluated by both experts and laypersons.


The methodology explored two central questions regarding emerging technologies:
 - Which basal attributes are mentally connected by laypersons, thereby forming clusters?
 - Which clusters of basal attributes significantly predict the acceptability of future technologies?
